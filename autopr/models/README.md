## 🌳 Living Summary

This folder contains several files that serve different purposes in an automated workflow project. The `artifacts.py` file defines Pydantic models for representing messages, threads, issues, and pull requests. The `config` folder contains files for creating Pydantic models, defining actions and workflows, and managing variables and parameters. The `events.py` file defines Pydantic models for various events that can trigger the project to run. The `executable.py` file defines types and classes related to context variables, templates, and executable actions.


### `__init__.py`

📄 This file is empty.


### `artifacts.py`

📄 This file defines several Pydantic models for representing messages, threads, issues, and pull requests.  
🔗 It imports necessary modules and type aliases.  
📝 The `Message` model represents a single message with a body and an author.  
🧵 The `Thread` model represents a collection of messages.  
🆘 The `Issue` model represents an issue with a number, title, author, and timestamp. It inherits from `Thread`.  
🔀 The `PullRequest` model represents a pull request with additional fields like base branch and head branch. It also inherits from `Issue`.  
🔒 The `CodeComment` model is commented out, but it represents a code comment with details like commit SHA, filepath, and status. It would inherit from `Thread`.  
📝 The `DiffStr` type alias is defined as a string.


### `config`

This folder contains files that serve different purposes in an automated workflow project. The `common.py` file provides templates for creating Pydantic models with different validation settings. The `elements.py` file defines models and classes for executing actions, workflows, and choices. The `entrypoints.py` file provides a framework for defining and managing workflows and triggers. The `transform.py` file defines classes for transforming variables between configuration and action types. The `value_declarations.py` file defines and renders variable and parameter declarations within a context. The `__init__.py` file is a placeholder for future content.


### `events.py`

📄 This file defines a set of Pydantic models for various events that can trigger AutoPR to run.
🔗 The models are used to represent different types of events such as label addition, comment addition, and push to a branch.
🧩 The `Event` model is the base model for all events and contains common fields like `event_type`.
📌 The `LabelEvent` model represents an event triggered when a label is added to an issue or pull request.
💬 The `CommentEvent` model represents an event triggered when a comment is added to an issue or pull request.
🚀 The `PushEvent` model represents an event triggered when a push is made to a branch.
🔀 The file also defines a `Union` type `EventUnion` that can be used to represent any of these event types.
🗂️ There is a commented-out `CodeReviewEvent` model that represents an event triggered when a comment is added to a code review.
📚 The purpose of this file is to provide a structured way to handle different types of events in the AutoPR system.


### `executable.py`

📝 This file defines various types and classes related to context variables, templates, and executable actions. 
📝 It includes type aliases for different string types used in the code. 
📝 The `ContextDict` class is a dictionary subclass that provides methods for accessing values by path and rendering templates. 
📝 The `ExecutableId` class is a subclass of `str` that represents an executable action identifier. 
📝 There are several forward references and union types defined for different types of executables. 
📝 The file also includes a `control_words` list and a `ControlWords` type alias for literal values of control words. 
📝 The purpose of this file is to provide type annotations and definitions for the codebase related to context variables and executable actions.
