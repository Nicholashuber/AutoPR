The purpose of this file is to define a Python class called "WriteIntoFile" that performs the following actions:
- It takes input parameters such as the filepath, content, and whether to append or replace the file content.
- It writes the specified content into the specified file, either by appending it to the end or replacing the entire file content.
- It returns an output indicating whether the file was written to successfully.
- It can be executed as a standalone script to manually run the "WriteIntoFile" action with predefined input parameters and remove the created file afterwards.
