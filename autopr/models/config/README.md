## 🌳 Living Summary

This folder contains files related to an automated workflow system. The `common.py` file defines Pydantic models for strict and extra validation. The `elements.py` file defines models and actions for the automation framework. The `entrypoints.py` file defines workflow models and triggers for the automated process. The `transform.py` file handles the transformation between config variables and action variables. The `value_declarations.py` file provides a system for defining and rendering variables and declarations in a configuration environment.


### `__init__.py`

📄 This file is empty.


### `common.py`

📄 This file defines two Pydantic models: `StrictModel` and `ExtraModel`.
🔍 `StrictModel` is a base model that enforces strict validation, forbidding any extra fields.
🔧 `StrictModel` has a configuration option `smart_union` that controls whether coercion is applied when not necessary.
🧩 `ExtraModel` is another base model that allows extra fields.
🔧 `ExtraModel` has a configuration option `extra` that allows for the presence of extra fields.


### `elements.py`

📝 This file defines models and actions for an automation framework.
🤖 It includes classes for context actions, conditionals, and executable actions.
🔀 It also defines models for workflow invocation and workflow definition.
📦 The file dynamically builds action models based on currently defined actions.
🏗️ The models include fields for inputs, outputs, and other configuration options.
⚙️ The file also includes imports from external libraries like pydantic and yaml.
❓ Some parts of the code are marked as TODO and need to be implemented.
📚 There are comments throughout the file explaining the purpose of different sections.
🔍 The file has been organized into sections for context, executables, and workflows.
📄 The top-level configuration is defined as a dictionary of workflow definitions.


### `entrypoints.py`

📝 This file contains code that defines workflow models and triggers for an automated process.
🔧 The purpose of the file is to dynamically build workflow models based on currently defined workflows for better type hints and autocompletion.
🔀 The file also defines triggers such as label triggers, comment triggers, and push triggers that can initiate the automated process based on specific events.
📄 The file includes functions to retrieve all executable IDs and build workflow definitions.
🔗 It imports various modules and types to support the functionality of the defined models and triggers.
📚 The file also includes code to generate JSON schemas for the defined models and configurations.
🔖 The JSON schemas can be used for validation and documentation purposes.
💡 The file can be executed as a standalone script to generate JSON schema files based on the defined models and configurations.
📂 The generated JSON schema files are saved as "trigger_schema.json", "workflow_schema.json", and "strict_workflow_schema.json".
🗒️ Overall, this file provides the foundational components and definitions for an automated workflow system.


### `transform.py`

📄 This file defines two classes: `TransformsInto` and `TransformsFrom`.
🔄 The purpose of these classes is to handle the transformation between config variables and action variables.
⚙️ `TransformsInto` provides a method to transform a config variable into the corresponding action variable type.
🔀 `TransformsFrom` provides a method to retrieve the config variable type.
🔧 The classes are generic and can handle different types of variables.
📝 The file also imports necessary modules and defines type variables.
🔒 The methods in the classes are not implemented and need to be overridden in subclasses.
📚 The file uses typing annotations for type hinting.
📝 The purpose of this file is to provide a framework for transforming variables between config and action contexts.


### `value_declarations.py`

📄 This file contains Python code for defining variables and declarations used in a configuration system. 
🔧 It provides classes for different types of variable declarations, such as template declarations, variable declarations, constant declarations, lambda declarations, and parameter declarations. 
📝 These declarations can be rendered and evaluated within a context. 
📑 The file also defines a parameter class for representing parameters passed in trigger invocations. 
🔀 The code uses typing annotations for type hinting. 
📚 It imports various modules and libraries such as datetime, json, os, random, re, sys, time, typing, and yaml. 
⚙️ The file includes an evaluation context dictionary that contains references to these imported modules. 
🔖 The purpose of this file is to provide a flexible and extensible system for defining and rendering variables and declarations in a configuration environment. 
🌟 It is part of a larger codebase related to an automated processing system. 
🚧 The file is a work in progress and some parts may be incomplete or subject to further development.
