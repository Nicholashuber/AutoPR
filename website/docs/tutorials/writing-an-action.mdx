# 💧 Writing an Action

**Actions** are written in **python**; they define small reusable blocks of functionality. 

They are defined in [the `autopr/actions` folder](https://github.com/irgolic/AutoPR/tree/main/autopr/actions).
You can also define custom actions in your own repository, placing them in `.autopr/actions`.

To get acquainted with actions, let's walk through all the elements of a simple action one-by-one.
Our example action will **run a bash command and return its output**.
If you'd like to get started quickly by copying the example action's full code, head to [quickstart at the bottom of the page](#quickstart-the-full-code-example).

## 🏡 Inputs and Outputs are Pydantic Models

To configure actions, and for actions to communicate with each other, they may receive **inputs** and send **outputs**. 

These are defined with [**pydantic**](https://docs.pydantic.dev/1.10/), a popular python library for data validation and serialization.


```python
import pydantic

# Our action will receive a `command` string as its input
class BashInputs(pydantic.BaseModel):
    command: str


# Our action will return `stdout` and `stderr` strings as its output, 
# which are the standard output and standard error streams of the command
class BashOutputs(pydantic.BaseModel):
    stdout: str
    stderr: str
```

## 🏷️ Actions have IDs and are Strongly Typed

Each action must have a unique ID, which is used to reference the action in the workflow. This ID must be unique among all actions and workflows.

To declare an action with the inputs and outputs defined above, we create a class that inherits from the `Action` class.
The inputs and outputs are passed as generic arguments to the `Action` class, and annotated on the `run` method.
This might look a bit complicated, but it makes sure that we don't make any mistakes when writing our action.


```python
from autopr.actions.base import Action


class BashAction(Action[BashInputs, BashOutputs]):
    id = "my-bash"
    
    async def run(self, inputs: BashInputs) -> BashOutputs:
        # TODO execute the command and return the outputs 
        ...

```

If an action does not receive inputs or outputs, you can pass `None` as the argument instead of a pydantic model.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="noinputs" label="Without Inputs">

```python
class ActionWithoutInputs(Action[None, BashOutputs]):
    id = "action-without-inputs"

    async def run(self, inputs: None) -> BashOutputs:
        ...
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="nooutputs" label="Without Outputs">

```python
class ActionWithoutInputs(Action[BashInputs, None]):
    id = "action-without-inputs"

    async def run(self, inputs: BashInputs) -> None:
        ...
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="noio" label="Without Inputs or Outputs">

```python
class ActionWithoutInputs(Action[None, None]):
    id = "action-without-inputs"

    async def run(self, inputs: None) -> None:
        ...
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


## 🏃 Actions run asynchronously

The action's `run` method is an `async` method, which means that it runs using python's [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) library.
This means that if an action ever has to wait for something, it can do so while yielding control to other actions and not blocking the entire workflow.

Finally, let's implement the Bash action's `run` method.


```python
import asyncio


class BashAction(Action[BashInputs, BashOutputs]):
    """
    Run a bash command and return its output.
    """
    
    id = "my-bash"

    async def run(self, inputs: BashInputs) -> BashOutputs:
        # Get the input value
        command = inputs.command
        
        # Run the command
        process = await asyncio.create_subprocess_shell(
            command,
            shell=True,
            stdout=asyncio.subprocess.PIPE,
            stderr=asyncio.subprocess.PIPE,
        )
        # Get standard output and standard error streams
        stdout, stderr = await process.communicate()

        # Set the output values
        return BashOutputs(
            stdout=stdout.decode("utf-8"),
            stderr=stderr.decode("utf-8"),
        )
```

## 🧪 Actions can easily be previewed

To preview an action, you can run it manually using the `run_action_manually` utility function.
This will create a temporary GitHub repository, and run the action in it.
Feel free to use this space as a scratchpad to test your action.

```python
# When you run this file
if __name__ == "__main__":
    from autopr.tests.utils import run_action_manually
    asyncio.run(
        # Run the action manually
        run_action_manually(
            action=BashAction,
            inputs=BashInputs(
                command="echo 'Hello World!'"
            ),
        )
    )
```

import Admonition from '@theme/Admonition';

<Admonition type="tip" icon="" title="Output">

```
Start section: 🚀 Running my_bash-3
Inputs: {
  "command": "echo 'Hello World!'"
}
Outputs: {
  "stderr": "",
  "stdout": "Hello World!\n"
}
End section
```

</Admonition>

## 🔨 Actions are simple to test

When you implement an action, please add a test for it in [the `tests/test_actions.py` file](https://github.com/irgolic/AutoPR/tree/main/autopr/tests/test_actions.py).
This can be as simple as adding a test case to the list of parameters in the `test_workflow` function.

```python

@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    "action_id, inputs, expected_outputs, repo_resource",
    [
        ...

        # Add a test case for your action, specifying:
        (
            # its ID;
            "my-bash",
            # sample inputs to run the action with;
            {
                "command": "echo Hello world!",
            },
            # the expected outputs;
            {
                "stdout": "Hello world!\n",
                "stderr": "",
            },
            # if necessary, the name of a mock repository resource to use (see `tests/repo_resources`);
            None,
        ),

        ...
    ]
)
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_actions(
    mocker,
    action_id: ExecutableId,
    inputs: ContextDict,
    expected_outputs: dict[str, Any],
    repo_resource: Optional[str],
):
    ...

    outputs = await run_action_manually(
        action=action_id,
        inputs=inputs,
        repo_resource=repo_resource
    )
    assert outputs == expected_outputs

```

## 📝 Actions are Documented with Docstrings

Docstrings are used to document actions, and are displayed in the generated action reference documentation.

```python
class BashAction(Action[BashInputs, BashOutputs]):
    """
    Run a bash command and return its output.
    """

    id = "my-bash"

    async def run(self, inputs: BashInputs) -> BashOutputs:
        ...
```


## 🌕 Quickstart: The Full Code Example

Create a new file in the `actions` directory, and use this as a template to get started.


```python title="autopr/actions/bash.py"
import asyncio

import pydantic

from autopr.actions.base import Action


# The action's inputs
class Inputs(pydantic.BaseModel):
    command: str


# The action's outputs
class Outputs(pydantic.BaseModel):
    stdout: str
    stderr: str


class Bash(Action[Inputs, Outputs]):
    """
    Run a bash command and return its output.
    """

    id = "my-bash"

    async def run(self, inputs: Inputs) -> Outputs:
        # Get the input value
        command = inputs.command

        # Run the command
        process = await asyncio.create_subprocess_shell(
            command,
            shell=True,
            stdout=asyncio.subprocess.PIPE,
            stderr=asyncio.subprocess.PIPE,
        )
        # Get standard output and standard error streams
        stdout, stderr = await process.communicate()

        # Set the output values
        return Outputs(
            stdout=stdout.decode("utf-8"),
            stderr=stderr.decode("utf-8"),
        )


# When you run this file
if __name__ == "__main__":
    from autopr.tests.utils import run_action_manually
    asyncio.run(
        # Run the action manually
        run_action_manually(
            action=Bash,
            inputs=Inputs(
                command="echo 'Hello World!'"
            ),
        )
    )

```
