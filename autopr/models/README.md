## 🌳 Living Summary

This folder contains files related to an automated workflow system. The `artifacts.py` file defines Pydantic models for representing messages, threads, issues, and pull requests. The `config` folder contains files that define models, actions, triggers, and variable declarations for the automation framework. The `events.py` file defines classes for different types of events that can trigger the automated process. The `executable.py` file defines types, classes, and utility functions for context variables and templates. The `__init__.py` file is currently empty and may be intended for future use or as a placeholder.

### `artifacts.py`

📄 This file defines several Pydantic models for representing messages, threads, issues, and pull requests. 
🧵 The `Message` model represents a single message with a body and an author. 
🧵 The `Thread` model represents a collection of messages. 
🧵 The `Issue` model extends the `Thread` model and adds additional fields like number, title, author, and timestamp. 
🧵 The `PullRequest` model extends the `Issue` model and adds more fields like base branch, head branch, and base commit SHA. 
🗂️ There are some commented out code for a `CodeComment` model, which seems to represent comments on specific lines of code. 
🗂️ There is also a type alias `DiffStr` defined as a string. 
👀 The purpose of this file is to provide structured data models for representing messages, threads, issues, and pull requests in a Python application.


### `config`

This folder contains files related to an automated workflow system. The `common.py` file defines Pydantic models for strict and extra validation. The `elements.py` file defines models and actions for the automation framework. The `entrypoints.py` file defines workflow models and triggers for the automated process. The `transform.py` file handles the transformation between config variables and action variables. The `value_declarations.py` file provides a system for defining and rendering variables and declarations in a configuration environment.


### `events.py`

📄 This file defines several classes related to events in AutoPR.
🔧 The purpose of this file is to provide a model for different types of events that can trigger AutoPR to run.
🚀 The `Event` class is the base class for all events and contains common attributes.
🏷️ The `LabelEvent` class represents an event triggered when a label is added to an issue or pull request.
💬 The `CommentEvent` class represents an event triggered when a comment is added to an issue or pull request.
📌 The `PushEvent` class represents an event triggered when a push is made to a branch.
🔀 The `EventUnion` type is a union of different event types that can be used to handle multiple event scenarios.


### `executable.py`

📝 This file defines various types and classes related to context variables and templates. It also defines some utility functions for rendering templates and accessing values from the context by path.
