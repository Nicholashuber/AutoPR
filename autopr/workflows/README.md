## 🌳 Living Summary

This folder contains a collection of YAML files that define workflows for various tasks. The workflows automate processes such as collecting and loading workflows from YAML files, summarizing files and folders, inserting content into files, and summarizing changes in pull requests. Each file contains detailed documentation on its purpose and steps involved in the workflow. These files can be executed as standalone programs or used as reusable tasks in larger automation processes.


### `__init__.py`

📄 This file contains a Python script that is used to collect and load workflows from YAML files in a given directory and its subfolders.
🔍 The script searches for YAML files in the specified directory and its subfolders, and parses them using Pydantic.
🛠️ It includes functions for collecting workflows from a single file and for recursively loading workflows from a folder.
📂 The default workflows are loaded from the same directory as this script, while custom workflows can be specified in a separate folder or files.
⚙️ The loaded workflows are stored in a `TopLevelWorkflowConfig` object, which is returned by the `get_all_workflows` function.
📝 The `get_all_workflows` function accepts optional parameters for the configuration directory and repository path.
🚀 The script can be executed as a standalone program, printing the loaded workflows to the console.
🔧 The script also imports other modules and defines helper functions for logging and obtaining executable IDs.
🔒 The script is protected with a conditional `__name__ == "__main__"` block to prevent execution when imported as a module.
📖 The script is well-documented with docstrings and comments to explain its functionality.


### `autogenerate_readmes.yaml`

📄 This file defines a set of workflows for summarizing files and folders.
📝 The workflows include steps to read file contents, prompt for summaries, and generate formatted summaries.
📂 Folders are recursively summarized by summarizing each file and joining the summaries with the file names.
📝 The final summaries are written to a README file in the folder and committed to a repository.
🔄 The workflows can be executed to generate summaries for multiple folders.
🌳 The main workflow is "generate_summary" which determines if the input is a file or folder and calls the appropriate sub-workflow.
💻 The file uses variables and lambda functions to dynamically generate paths and summaries.
📚 The purpose of the file is to automate the generation of README summaries for files and folders.
🔄 The "generate_readme_summaries" workflow can be executed to generate summaries for all folders in the current directory.
💾 The cache of README summaries can be committed and pushed to a repository.


### `insert_into_readme.yaml`

📝 This file defines a YAML configuration for a task called "insert_into_readme".  
📝 The task is designed to insert content into a file between two HTML-style comments.  
📝 If the file does not exist, it will be created.  
📝 The content is specified using a tagname and the desired content to insert.  
📝 The task consists of three steps: reading the file, inserting the content, and writing the file.  
📝 The read_file step reads the contents of the file.  
📝 The insert_content_into_text step inserts the specified content between the HTML-style comments.  
📝 The write_into_file step writes the modified content back to the file.  
📝 The file includes commented-out outputs that could be enabled to capture the content after insertion.  
📝 The purpose of this file is to define a reusable task for inserting content into a file.


### `summarize_pr.yaml`

📝 The file defines a workflow for summarizing the changes in a pull request.
🔍 It uses the `git diff` command to obtain the changes in the pull request.
💡 The `prompt` action is used to collect a summary of the changes from the user.
📌 The user is instructed to express the summary in markdown format, with line items prefixed with emojis.
💬 The summary is then stored in a variable called `summary`.
💬 The `comment` action is used to post the summary as a comment.
💻 The file is intended to be used as part of a larger automation process.
🚀 It helps streamline the process of summarizing and communicating the changes in a pull request.
💪 The file provides a clear structure for collecting and sharing summaries of pull request changes.
📄 If the file is empty, there is no defined workflow for summarizing pull request changes.
