The purpose of this file is to define a class called "SerializableJsonSchemaObject" with various properties and methods. Here are the main purposes of this file:

1. Define a data model class: The file defines a class called "SerializableJsonSchemaObject" which serves as a data model for representing JSON schema objects.

2. Validation and transformation methods: The class includes several methods for validating and transforming the data within the JSON schema object. For example, there are methods for validating exclusive maximum and minimum values, validating references, and validating items.

3. Property access and manipulation: The class includes properties for accessing and manipulating various properties of the JSON schema object, such as "is_object", "is_array", "ref_object_name", "has_default", "has_constraint", and "ref_type".

4. Configuration and customization: The class includes a nested "Config" class that allows for configuration and customization of the behavior of the data model class. For example, it allows for specifying arbitrary types, ignored types, and smart casts.

5. Additional utility methods: The class includes additional utility methods such as "__init__" for initializing the object, "get_fields" for retrieving the fields of the object, and "validate_exclusive_maximum_and_exclusive_minimum" for validating exclusive maximum and minimum values.
