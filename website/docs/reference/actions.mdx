# üíß Actions

Actions are the building blocks of AutoPR. They are the smallest unit of work that can be performed by the system.

For an in-depth tutorial on how to write a basic action, check out the [tutorial](../tutorials/writing-an-action).

## üå± The Hello World Example

```python
import pydantic
from autopr.actions.base import Action


class Inputs(pydantic.BaseModel):
    name: str


class Outputs(pydantic.BaseModel):
    greeting: str


class Hello(Action[Inputs, Outputs]):
    id = "hello"

    async def run(self, inputs: Inputs) -> Outputs:
        return Outputs(greeting=f"Hello, {inputs.name}!")

```

## üìù Anatomy of an Action

Actions are defined as classes that inherit from `Action[Inputs, Outputs]`, where `Inputs` and `Outputs` are Pydantic
models that define the input and output data of the action.

The `run` method is the asynchronous entrypoint of the action. It receives the input data as a parameter and returns the output data
as a result.

The `id` attribute is a unique identifier for the action. It is used to reference the action in the workflows.


## üöö Services

Actions are able to perform both routine and platform-specific throught the utilization of **services**.
These services abstract and encapsulate specialized functions, enabling actions to operate seamlessly across different contexts.

They are accessible as instance attributes. For example, if you'd like to cache some data, you can do so by calling
`self.cache_service.store(key, value)`, and retrieve it later with `self.cache_service.retrieve(key)`.

The services available are:
- **publish_service**: Streamlines the creation, management, and publishing of structured updates to pull request (PR) descriptions.
- **platform_service**: Provides a suite of tools tailored for interactions with platforms (eg. Github), allowing for tasks like fetching issue or PR metadata.
- **cache_service**: Ensures data persistence by allowing actions to save and retrieve data across different runs.
- **commit_service**: Offers a structured approach to git operations, such as staging, committing, and pushing changes.

Below are listed all the mentioned services, with their methods and properties.

import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="publish_service" label="Publish Service">

`PublishService` provides a structured way to publish updates on the status of the action.
You can modify the PR, add simple textual updates, code blocks, or create collapsible sections.

Example of usage can be seen in
[`prompt`](https://github.com/irgolic/AutoPR/blob/main/autopr/actions/prompt.py).

#### Key Methods:

- `publish_update(text, section_title=None)`: Adds a textual update to the current section.
- `publish_code_block(heading, code, ...)`: Embeds a code block as a collapsible child in the current section.
- `start_section(title)`: Initializes a new section.
- `update_section(title: str)`: Updates the title of the current section.
- `end_section(title=None)`: Concludes the current section.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="platform_service" label="Platform Service">

`PlatformService` offers platform-specific operations, such as getting issue, retrieving PR, and updating PR comments.

#### Key Methods:

- `find_existing_pr(head_branch, base_branch)`: Searches for an existing open pull request with the specified head and base branches.
- `create_pr(title, bodies, draft, head_branch, base_branch)`: Creates a new pull request on GitHub.
- `update_pr_body(pr_number, body)`: Modifies the body of an existing pull request.
- `update_pr_title(pr_number, title)`: Alters the title of an existing pull request.
- `update_comment(comment_id, body)`: Updates the content of a specific comment on GitHub.
- `publish_comment(text, issue_number)`: Adds a comment to a specific issue or pull request.
- `set_pr_draft_status(pr_number, is_draft)`: Adjusts the draft status of a pull request.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cache_service" label="Cache Service">

The `CacheService` offers a mechanism to store and retrieve data in a caching system, making it easier to manage
transient data that doesn't need permanent storage but should be quickly accessible. In the backend, `CacheService` is implemented with [shelve](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shelve.html).

Example of usage can be seen in action [`prompt`](https://github.com/irgolic/AutoPR/blob/main/autopr/actions/prompt.py).

#### Key Methods:

- `store(key, value, namespace=None)`: Saves the provided value with the specified key in the cache.
- `retrieve(key, namespace=None)`: Retrieves the value associated with the specified key from the cache. If the key isn't found, it returns `None`.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="commit_service" label="Commit Service">

The `CommitService` offers a structured way to manage git operations on a repository, particularly focusing on creating
branches, committing changes, and pushing updates to remote repositories.

Example of usage can be seen in actions
[`commit_and_push`](https://github.com/irgolic/AutoPR/blob/main/autopr/actions/commit_and_push.py).

#### Key Methods:

- `commit(commit_message, push=True, filepaths=None)`: Handles the commit operation. If there's an existing empty
  commit, it removes it. It then stages changes, either all changes or only those specified in `filepaths`, and makes a
  commit with the provided `commit_message`. If `push` is set to `True`, it also pushes the commit to the remote repository.
