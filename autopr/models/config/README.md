## 🌳 Living Summary

This folder contains files that serve different purposes in an automated workflow project. The `common.py` file provides templates for creating Pydantic models with different validation settings. The `elements.py` file defines models and classes for executing actions, workflows, and choices. The `entrypoints.py` file provides a framework for defining and managing workflows and triggers. The `transform.py` file defines classes for transforming variables between configuration and action types. The `value_declarations.py` file defines and renders variable and parameter declarations within a context. The `__init__.py` file is a placeholder for future content.


### `__init__.py`

📄 This file is empty.     
📝 It serves as a placeholder for future content.     
👀 Its purpose is to be a starting point for new work.     
🔍 It can be used for documentation or code organization.     
📌 It's a blank canvas waiting to be filled.     
💡 It's an opportunity to create something new.     
🚀 It's a launching point for ideas and development.     
📝 It represents a fresh start or clean slate.     
📋 It's a placeholder for future code or information.     
📁 It's a file waiting to be populated with content.    


### `common.py`

📄 This file contains two Pydantic model classes: `StrictModel` and `ExtraModel`.
🔒 The `StrictModel` class enforces strict validation rules and does not allow any extra fields.
🔀 The `ExtraModel` class allows for extra fields that are not defined in the model.
🧩 These classes are used to define the data models for the action/workflow invocation in the configuration.
💡 The purpose of this file is to provide a template for creating Pydantic models with different validation settings.


### `elements.py`

📝 This file defines various models and classes related to the execution of actions, workflows, and choices.
📚 It includes models for context management, actions, conditionals, and executable objects.
🔄 The file also defines models for iterating over values and invoking workflows.
🔧 There are models for configuring actions and workflows, specifying their inputs and outputs.
📋 The file provides a way to dynamically build action models from currently defined actions.
🔧 It also includes a top-level workflow configuration model.
🔀 The file has forward references to ensure type hints and autocompletion.
📝 The purpose of this file is to provide a structured and configurable way to define and execute actions and workflows.
🚀 It allows for the management of context variables, conditional execution, and iteration over values.
📋 The file serves as a foundation for implementing automated processes and workflows.


### `entrypoints.py`

📝 This file contains Python code that defines models and functions for building and working with workflows and triggers.
🔄 The purpose of this file is to provide a framework for defining and managing workflows and triggers in an automated process.
🔧 It includes models for workflow configurations, workflow invocations, triggers, and executable actions.
🔀 The file also includes functions for dynamically building workflow models and retrieving executable IDs.
📦 It imports modules such as `pydantic` and `json` for data validation and serialization.
📚 The code uses type hints to provide better autocompletion and type checking support.
📄 The file also includes code for generating JSON schemas for the defined models.
📝 The generated schemas can be used for validating and documenting workflow and trigger configurations.
🔧 The main block of the file writes the generated schemas to separate JSON files.
💡 This file serves as a foundation for implementing automated workflows and triggers in a Python project.


### `transform.py`

📝 This file defines two classes: `TransformsInto` and `TransformsFrom`.  
🔀 These classes are used for transforming between config and action variables.  
🔧 They provide methods for transforming config variables into the type used in the action.  
❌ The `transform_from_config` method of `TransformsInto` is not implemented.  
❌ The `_get_config_type` method of `TransformsFrom` is not implemented.


### `value_declarations.py`

📄 This file contains the definition of various variable declarations and parameter declarations used in a configuration model.
🖋️ The purpose of this file is to provide a way to define and render different types of variables within a context.
📝 The file includes classes for template declarations, variable declarations, constant declarations, and lambda declarations.
💡 These declarations can be rendered within a context to obtain their respective values.
🔧 The file also includes a class for parameter declarations, which references a parameter passed in trigger invocation.
📝 The parameter declaration can be rendered within a context to obtain the value of the referenced parameter.
🔄 The file defines a union type for value declarations, which includes template, variable, constant, lambda, and parameter declarations.
🔧 The purpose of this file is to provide a flexible and extensible way to define and render variables and parameters in a configuration model.
📄 The file is part of a larger project and can be used to define and handle variables and parameters in a dynamic and customizable manner.
