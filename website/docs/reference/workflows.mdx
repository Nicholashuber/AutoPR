# üåä Workflows

A workflow is an orchestration of actions.
It can be triggered by an event, or it can be invoked by another workflow.
In this section, we'll walk you through all the building blocks of a workflow.

AutoPR comes with some default workflows, which you can find in [the workflow catalogue](../workflow-catalogue).

It's easy to define custom workflows to automate various tasks.
You can define workflows in `.autopr/workflows.yaml` or `.autopr/workflows/*.yaml`.

## üóùÔ∏è Workflow Skeleton

A workflow definition has the following structure:

```yaml
workflow_name:
  inputs:
    - input1
    - input2
  outputs:
    - output1
    - output2
  steps:
    ...
```

This defines a workflow with the name `workflow_name`,
which has two inputs named `input1` and `input2`, and two outputs named `output1` and `output2`.

In the `steps` section, we operate with inputs to produce the desired outputs.

Both `inputs` and `outputs` are optional.

## üèÉ‚Äç Steps

There are multiple different possible steps to use in a workflow.
Each step has a different purpose and syntax.

### `set_vars`

Workflows use the `set_vars` step to declare and construct variables.

The same syntax can be used in action and workflow inputs, defaulting to `template`.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="constants" label="Constants">

In AutoPR workflows, you can define constants with the `const` keyword.
These hold various types (strings, integers, lists, dictionaries, etc.)

```yaml
set_constant_workflow:
  outputs:
    - int_const
    - str_const
    - list_const
    - dict_const
  steps:
    - set_vars:
        int_const:
          const: 1
        str_const:
          const: "Hello world!"
        list_const:
          const:
            - 1
            - 2
            - 3
        dict_const:
          const:
            key1: value1
            key2: value2
```

Here, we've defined a workflow named `set_constant_workflow` that defines and outputs four constants:
- `int_const` with value `1`
- `str_const` with value `"Hello world!"`
- `list_const` with value `[1, 2, 3]`
- `dict_const` with value `{"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}`

You'll notice a similar pattern in the other examples as well.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="templates" label="Templates">

`template` uses Jinja2 templating to generate the variable's value. They can be useful when you already have a variable
that you want to use as a template for another variable.

```yaml
set_template_workflow:
  outputs:
    - templated_var
  steps:
    - set_vars:
        var_to_template:
          const: "World"
        templated_var:
          template: 'Hello, {{ template }}!'
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="lambdas" label="Lambdas">

`lambda` is a Python expression that computes the variable's value.

```yaml
set_lambda_workflow:
  outputs:
    - lambda_var
  steps:
    - set_vars:
        first_list:
          const:
            - 1
            - 2
            - 3
        second_list:
          const:
            - "a"
            - "b"
            - "c"
        lambda_var:
          lambda: "dict(zip(first_list, second_list))"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="params" label="Params">

`param` is an optional field that is assigned the value of the variable if it is not defined in the trigger declaration.

```yaml
set_params_workflow:
  outputs:
    - param_var
  steps:
    - set_vars:
        param_var:
          param:
            name: IGNORE_FILES
            default: []
```

If `IGNORE_FILES` is defined in the trigger, `param_var` will be assigned its value.
Otherwise, `param_var` will be assigned an empty list.

In the triggers, such parameters are specified as follows:

```yaml
triggers:
  - name: trigger_name
    workflow: set_params_workflow
    params:
      IGNORE_FILES:
        - "file1"
        - "file2"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="vars" label="Variables">

If we've got already variable in scope and we want to assign its value to another variable, this is the way to do it:

```yaml
set_variable_workflow:
  outputs:
    - second_variable
  steps:
    - set_vars:
        first_variable:
          const: "Hello world!"
        second_variable:
          var: first_variable
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### `action`

`action` is a step that allows you to invoke an action from the [action catalogue](../action-catalogue).

An action is a predefined operation or task that has inputs and outputs.

One of the actions that comes with AutoPR is the `bash` action, which allows you to execute arbitrary bash commands,
so we'll use it as an example:

```yaml
bash_workflow:
  inputs:
    - message
  outputs:
    - stdout
  steps:
    - action: bash
      inputs:
        command:
          template: |
            'echo "{{ message }}"'
      outputs:
        stdout: stdout
```

Note how the inputs use the same syntax as the `set_vars` step.

When this workflow is triggered, it will execute the `bash` action with the given command and return its output in the `stdout` output.

### `workflow`

If you build a workflow that performs a specific task, you can invoke it from another workflow with the `workflow` step.
This is particularly useful if you either want to reduce complexity of the workflows or
reuse some of the workflows you've already defined.

The available workflows are listed in the [workflow catalogue](../workflow-catalogue),
or you can use one of your [custom-defined workflows](../tutorials/writing-a-workflow).

Like invoking an action, invoking a workflow also has inputs and outputs.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="setvarsworkflowinvocation" label="Vars example">

Here's an example workflow that combines two variables using the `lambda` keyword:

```yaml
set_vars_workflow:
  inputs:
    - var1
    - var2
  outputs:
    - var3
  steps:
    - set_vars:
        var3:
          lambda: "var1 + var2"
```

Now, we can define another workflow, which will use the `set_vars_workflow` we've just defined.

```yaml
usage_of_set_vars_workflow:
  outputs:
    - var3
  steps:
    - workflow: set_vars_workflow
      inputs:
        var1:
          const: 1
        var2:
          const: 2
      outputs:
        var3: var3
```

This workflow, when triggered, will return value `3` in its `var3` output.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="inputs" label="Bash example">

We could also invoke the workflow defined above in the `action` section:

```yaml
invocation_of_bash_workflow:
  outputs:
    - output
  steps:
    - workflow: bash_workflow
      inputs:
        message:
          const: "Hello world!"
      outputs:
        stdout: output
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Note how the inputs use the same syntax as the `set_vars` step.

### `if_lambda`

Conditionals are decision-making steps based on certain conditions, the first of which is the `if_lambda` step.

Assuming we've got workflows `summarize_file` and `summarize_dir` defined, we can use them in a conditional: 

```yaml
summarize_entry:
  inputs:
    - path
  outputs:
    - summary
  steps:
    - if_lambda: not os.path.isdir(path)
      then: summarize_file
      else: summarize_dir
```

This workflow has a very important assumption that the `summarize_file` and `summarize_dir` workflows have variable `path`
as its only input and `summary` as its only output. This is because the `summarize_entry` workflow uses the `path` input
and outputs.

### `iterate`

If we have a variable that's a list, or we would like to iterate a number of times,
we can use the `iterate` step and perform some action or workflow multiple times.

Workflows can iterate over lists or ranges, and combine with the `action` and `workflow` keyword.
Most notably, they add an `as` keyword to define the name of the variable that will be used in the iteration,
and change the `outputs` keyword to `list_outputs`, to define the list of outputs that will be returned.

[//]: # (TODO add workflow iteration example)

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="action" label="Action iteration over a list">

If `iterate`'s value is a variable of type `list`, the workflow will use iteration over a list.

```yaml
iter_var_action:
  inputs:
    - list_of_commands
  outputs:
    - outputs_list
    - concatenated_outputs
  steps:
    - action: bash
      iterate: list_of_commands
      as: cmd
      inputs:
        command:
          template: |
            '{{ cmd }}'
      list_outputs:
        stdout: outputs_list
    - action: bash
      inputs:
        command:
          template: |
            echo '{{ outputs_list | join("") }}'
      outputs:
        stdout: concatenated_outputs
```

This workflow will execute all the commands in the `list_of_commands` input and return the list of outputs in the `outputs_list` output.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="workflow" label="Action iteration over a range">

If `iterate`'s value is an integer, it will iterate as many times as specified. Variable, listed in the `as` field will
serve as an iterator variable, which will be incremented by one in each iteration.

```yaml
iter_range_by_index_action:
  inputs:
    - list_of_commands
  outputs:
    - outputs_list
    - concatenated_outputs
  steps:
    - action: bash
      iterate: 2
      as: cmd
      inputs:
        command:
          lambda: '{{ list_of_commands[cmd] }}'
      list_outputs:
        stdout: outputs_list
    - action: bash
      inputs:
        command:
          template: |
            echo '{{ outputs_list | join("") }}'
      outputs:
        stdout: concatenated_outputs
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


## üöÄ Let's go!

Great, now you know how to define workflows. The next step is to [define your own custom workflow](../tutorials/writing-a-workflow).
