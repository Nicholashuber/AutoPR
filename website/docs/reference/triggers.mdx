# üèÅ Triggers

Triggers are the sensors of your repository. They monitor for specific events, and once an event
occurs, they initiate a workflow. Let's deep dive into how to write triggers.

**Important**: Before you begin writing a trigger, [set up validation in your editor](../tutorials/setting-up-yaml-schema) for ease of writing.

Triggers are located in your `.autopr` configuration directory, as the `.autopr/triggers.yaml` file.
Alternatively, you can also define triggers in the `.autopr/triggers/*.yaml` folder.

## üßê Properties of different triggers

Each trigger has the `run` property, which specified the workflow that should be activated when the trigger condition is met.
The `run` property must match the name of either a [default workflow](../workflow-catalogue) or a [custom-defined workflow](../tutorials/writing-a-workflow).

They also have the `parameters` property, which is an optional object that contains global variables used in the workflow.
For example, the `parameters` property can be used to define the `FILE_SUMMARY_PROMPT` variable, which is used in the
[generate_readme_summaries](../workflow-catalogue#generate_readme_summaries) workflow.

Additionally, each respective trigger has its own unique properties:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="labeltrigger" label="Label Trigger">

Activates when a label is added to an issue or a pull request.
- **`label_substring`**: Trigger when a label contains this substring.
- **`on_issue`**: Whether the trigger should respond to issues.
- **`on_pull_request`**: Whether the trigger should respond to pull requests.

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: "label"
    label_substring: "summarize"
    on_issue: false
    on_pull_request: true
    run: "summarize_pr"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="pushtrigger" label="Push Trigger">

Activates when a push is made to the specified branch.
- **`branch_name`**: Pinpoints the branch that the trigger observes for changes.

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: "push"
    branch_name: "main"
    run: "generate_readme_summaries"
    parameters:
      FILE_SUMMARY_PROMPT: "Write a summary of this file for first-timers. Use 3-6 bullet points with emojis."
      FOLDER_SUMMARY_PROMPT: "Give a quick summary of this folder in 3-5 sentences."
      IGNORE_FILES:
        - docs
        - .github
        - .autopr
        - tests
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## üìÑ Example

Below is an example of a `.autopr/triggers.yaml` file, that summarizes pull requests when the `summarize` label is added,
and generates README summaries when a push is made to the `main` branch.

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: label
    label_substring: summarize
    on_issue: false
    on_pull_request: true
    run: summarize_pr
  - type: push
    branch_name: main
    run: generate_readme_summaries
    parameters:
      FILE_SUMMARY_PROMPT: "Write a summary of this file for first-timers. Use 3-6 bullet points with emojis."
      FOLDER_SUMMARY_PROMPT: "Give a quick summary of this folder in 3-5 sentences."
      IGNORE_FILES:
        - docs
        - .github
        - .autopr
        - tests
```
