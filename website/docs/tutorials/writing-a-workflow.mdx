# üåä Writing a Workflow

In this tutorial, we'll write a simple workflow that summarizes the changes in a pull request.
Please note that this workflow resembles one of the default workflows in AutoPR, but is altered for sake of demonstration.

You can define custom workflows in the `.autopr/workflows.yaml` file or `.autopr/workflows/*.yaml` folder in your repository.

For a comprehensive overview of how to define workflows, please refer to [the workflows refrence](../reference/workflows).

## üê£ Before we get Started

Workflows are written in YAML.

[**Set up validation in your editor**](setting-up-yaml-schema) before you begin writing a workflow;
this will help you discover the available actions and workflows, and help you write workflows faster and with fewer errors.

You may use either the `workflow_schema.json` or `strict_workflow_schema.json` file.
If you'd like to strictly type the workflow invocations as well, use the `strict_workflow_schema.json` file.
As per the guide linked above, 
you will need to regenerate it after defining the skeletons of your workflows, as it is generated from the workflows themselves.

## üí¶ The Actions

The actions we'll be using are:
- `bash`, to get the diff of the pull request;
- `prompt`, to prompt the user to summarize the changes in the pull request;
- `comment`, to post the summary as a comment on the pull request.

## üåä The Workflow Definition

Let's define the skeleton, including the inputs and outputs, which are defined as a list of variable names.

```yaml
summarize_my_pr:
  inputs:
    # The pull request the workflow was triggered by
    - pull_request
  outputs:
    # The summary of the changes in the pull request
    - summary
  steps:
    ...

summarize_and_comment:
  inputs:
    # The pull request the workflow was triggered by
    - pull_request
  steps:
    ...
```

We have defined two workflows, one which summarizes the PR, and one which invokes it, and then posts the summary as a comment on the pull request.
`summarize_and_comment` will be the entrypoint we would specify in the trigger.

In this case, `pull_request` is a special input that is automatically passed when the workflow is triggered by a pull request.
Its model is defined as `PullRequest` in [`models/artifacts.py`](https://github.com/irgolic/AutoPR/blob/main/autopr/models/artifacts.py#L31).

## üèÉ‚Äç Defining the `summarize_my_pr` workflow

Let's add the steps one by one.

### Getting the Diff of the Pull Request

We will invoke `git diff` bash command, against the pull request's base commit, to get the diff of the pull request.

```yaml
- action: bash
  inputs:
    command: 'git diff {{ pull_request.base_commit_sha }}'
  outputs:
    stdout: pr_diff
```

Inputs are [jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) templates by default,
which means we can use variables like `pull_request.base_commit_sha` in them.

Outputs define the names of the variables that the action will output.

Alternatively, we could explicitly denote the input as a template,
or define it as a template first, and then explicitly reference it as a variable.
We could even construct the string with a python lambda function.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="explicittemplate" label="Explicit Template">

```yaml
- action: bash
  inputs:
    command:
      template: 'git diff {{ pull_request.base_commit_sha }}'
  outputs:
    stdout: pr_diff
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="setvars" label="Separate Variable">

```yaml
- set_vars:
    pr_diff_command:
      template: 'git diff {{ pull_request.base_commit_sha }}'
- action: bash
  inputs:
    command:
      var: pr_diff_command
  outputs:
    stdout: pr_diff
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="lambda" label="Lambda">

```yaml
- action: bash
  inputs:
    command:
      lambda: |
        "git diff " + pull_request.base_commit_sha
  outputs:
    stdout: pr_diff
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Please see [the workflows refrence](../reference/workflows#variable-declarations) for more information on all the possible ways to define inputs.

### Generating the Summary

Next, we'll prompt OpenAI's language models to summarize the changes in the pull request.

The action takes instructions and a prompt as inputs, as well as prompt context.
Prompt context is a list of variables and headings that prefix the language model prompt.
The entries follow a similar syntax to `set_vars` and `inputs`, allowing use of the `var`, `template`, and `lambda` keywords coupled with the `heading`.

The action outputs the result of the prompt as a variable caled `summary`.

If you'd like to abstract any input (such as the prompt) out into a parameter configurable in the trigger definition,
you can use the `param` keyword and a default value to reference the variable.
This way, you can define the default value in the workflow definition, and override it in the trigger definition.
For sake of example, let's go with the parameterized version.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="simpleprompt" label="Simple">

```yaml
- action: prompt
  inputs:
    instructions: "Express yourself in beautiful markdown, mostly with line items, each prefixed with an emoji."
    prompt: |
      Summarize the changes in the pull request for each file, with concrete line items,
      prefix the line items with emoji to semantically highlight the contents of the changes.
      The file may have been trimmed, there will be a `... (trimmed) ...` line in the diff if so.
    prompt_context:
      - var: pr_diff
        heading: 'Diff of the changes in the pull request'
  outputs:
    result: summary
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="paramprompt" label="Parameterized">

```yaml
- action: prompt
  inputs:
    instructions: "Express yourself in beautiful markdown, mostly with line items, each prefixed with an emoji."
    prompt:
      param:
        name: SUMMARY_PROMPT
        default: |
          Summarize the changes in the pull request for each file, with concrete line items,
          prefix the line items with emoji to semantically highlight the contents of the changes.
          The file may have been trimmed, there will be a `... (trimmed) ...` line in the diff if so.
    prompt_context:
      - var: pr_diff
        heading: 'Diff of the changes in the pull request'
  outputs:
    result: summary
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

By default, the `prompt` action invokes `chatgpt-3.5-turbo-16k` model, but we can specify a different model by setting the `model` input.

### The full `summarize_my_pr` workflow

Our `summarize_my_pr` workflow is now complete.

```yaml
summarize_my_pr:
  inputs:
    # The pull request the workflow was triggered by
    - pull_request
  outputs:
    # The summary of the changes in the pull request
    - summary
  steps:
    # Get the diff of the pull request
    - action: bash
      inputs:
        command: 'git diff {{ pull_request.base_commit_sha }}'
      outputs:
        stdout: pr_diff
    # Generate the summary
    - action: prompt
      inputs:
        instructions: "Express yourself in beautiful markdown, mostly with line items, each prefixed with an emoji."
        prompt:
          param:
            name: SUMMARY_PROMPT
            default: |
              Summarize the changes in the pull request for each file, with concrete line items,
              prefix the line items with emoji to semantically highlight the contents of the changes.
              The file may have been trimmed, there will be a `... (trimmed) ...` line in the diff if so.
        prompt_context:
          - var: pr_diff
            heading: 'Diff of the changes in the pull request'
      outputs:
        result: summary
```

## üèÉ‚Äç Defining the `summarize_and_comment` Workflow

Now, we'll define the `summarize_and_comment` workflow, which invokes the `summarize_my_pr` workflow,
and then posts the summary as a comment on the pull request by running the `comment` action.

### Invoking the `summarize_my_pr` Workflow

We'll invoke the `summarize_my_pr` workflow, pass the pull request as an input, and receive the summary as an output.

```yaml
- workflow: summarize_my_pr
  inputs:
    pull_request:
      var: pull_request
  outputs:
    summary: comment_text
```

At this point, if you're using `strict_workflow_schema.json` for validation, 
and you've not regenerated it since defining the `summarize_my_pr` workflow,
you'll get an error on the above step.
Follow the instructions in the [**validation guide**](setting-up-yaml-schema) to regenerate the schema.

### Posting the Summary as a Comment

Finally, we'll post the summary as a comment on the pull request.

```yaml
- action: comment
  inputs:
    comment:
      var: comment_text
```

The action takes a `comment` input (the `comment_text` variable returned by the `summarize_my_pr` workflow),
which will be posted on the pull request.

### The full `summarize_and_comment` Workflow

The complete `summarize_and_comment` workflow is as follows:

```yaml
summarize_and_comment:
  inputs:
    # The pull request the workflow was triggered by
    - pull_request
  steps:
    # Summarize the pull request
    - workflow: summarize_my_pr
      inputs:
        pull_request:
          var: pull_request
      outputs:
        summary: comment_text
    # Post the summary as a comment on the pull request
    - action: comment
      inputs:
        comment:
          var: comment_text
```

## üåä The Complete Workflow File

The complete workflow file is as follows:

```yaml
summarize_my_pr:
  inputs:
    # The pull request the workflow was triggered by
    - pull_request

  outputs:
    # The summary of the changes in the pull request
    - summary

  steps:
    # Get the diff of the pull request
    - action: bash
      inputs:
        command: 'git diff {{ pull_request.base_commit_sha }}'
      outputs:
        stdout: pr_diff

    # Generate the summary
    - action: prompt
      inputs:
        instructions: "Express yourself in beautiful markdown, mostly with line items, each prefixed with an emoji."
        prompt:
          param:
            name: SUMMARY_PROMPT
            default: |
              Summarize the changes in the pull request for each file, with concrete line items,
              prefix the line items with emoji to semantically highlight the contents of the changes.
              The file may have been trimmed, there will be a `... (trimmed) ...` line in the diff if so.
        prompt_context:
          - var: pr_diff
            heading: 'Diff of the changes in the pull request'
      outputs:
        result: summary

summarize_pr:
  inputs:
    # The pull request the workflow was triggered by
    - pull_request

  steps:
    # Summarize the pull request
    - workflow: summarize_my_pr
      inputs:
        pull_request:
          var: pull_request
      outputs:
        summary: summary

    # Post the summary as a comment on the pull request
    - action: comment
      inputs:
        comment:
          var: summary
```

## üèÅ Triggering

Finally, we'll define the trigger that invokes the `summarize_and_comment` workflow.

The parameterized version will override the prompt with a custom prompt,
if the `prompt` action invocation above in `summarize_my_pr` is parameterized.

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: label
    label_substring: "summarize"
    on_pull_request: true
    run: summarize_and_comment

        Summarize the changes in the pull request for each file in 3-5 sentences.
        The file may have been trimmed, there will be a `... (trimmed) ...` line in the diff if so.
```
