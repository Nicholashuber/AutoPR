# 🌳 AutoPR

AutoPR breathes life into your repository with generative AI.

See the [installation guide](installing/github) to get started.

## Actions, Workflows and Triggers

AutoPR is configurable from the ground up.
Its key components are **actions**, **workflows** and **triggers**.

### 💧 Actions

**Actions** are written in **python**; they define small reusable bits of orthogonal functionality.

For more information, see [Writing an Action](tutorials/writing-an-action).

### 🌊 Workflows

**Workflows** are written in **YAML**; they provide a simple configurable language for orchestrating actions.

For more information, see [Writing a Workflow](tutorials/writing-a-workflow).

### 🏁 Triggers

**Triggers** are written in **YAML**; they provide a simple configurable language for triggering workflows.

For more information, see [the Triggers reference](reference/triggers).
