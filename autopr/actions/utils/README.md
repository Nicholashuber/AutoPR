### `prompt_context.py`

📄 This file contains the implementation of a prompt context model and its configuration representation.
🔢 The `PromptContext` class represents a dictionary mapping heading strings to context variable values.
🔤 It overrides the `__str__` method to format the context in a prompt-friendly way.
📝 The `PromptContextInConfig` class represents the configuration representation of the prompt context.
📝 It contains subclasses for different types of variable declarations in the context.
🔄 The `PromptContextInConfig` class also provides a transformation method to convert the configuration into an instance of `PromptContext`.
✨ The `PromptContextEntry` class represents a single entry in the context heading dictionary.
📚 The file also includes some utility functions related to string token length and template rendering.
🔒 The models in the file are defined using the Pydantic library for data validation and parsing.
🔧 The purpose of this file is to provide a structured representation of prompt context and its configuration for use in an automated prompt generation system.
